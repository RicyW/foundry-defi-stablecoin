This repo aims to develop a stablecoin and understand the key concepts of DeFi during implementation.

1. Relative Stability: Anchored or Pegged -> $1.00
   1. Chainlink price feed
   2. Set a function to exchange ETC/BTC
2. Stability Mechanism: Algorithmic (decentralised)
   1. Ppl only mint the stablecoin with enough collateral
3. Collateral: exogenous (crypto)
   1.ETH
   2.BTC

This project also aims to familiarise myself with foundry.
Foundry consists of:

- **Forge**: Ethereum testing framework (like Truffle, Hardhat and DappTools).
- **Cast**: Swiss army knife for interacting with EVM smart contracts, sending transactions and getting chain data.
- **Anvil**: Local Ethereum node, akin to Ganache, Hardhat Network.
- **Chisel**: Fast, utilitarian, and verbose solidity REPL.
